### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I've decided to make a career change into the field of IT, and I couldn't be more thrilled about it!

I've always loved tinkering with technology and solving problems. Well, I've finally decided to take the plunge and pursue my passion full-time. The world of IT is so dynamic and fast-paced, and I can't wait to dive in and be a part of it.

I've been doing a lot of research and learning as much as I can about different aspects of IT, from programming languages to network security. It's been an exhilarating journey so far, and I'm hungry to learn even more.

I've already started tailoring my resume and cover letter to highlight my relevant skills and experiences, and I'm feeling really positive about my chances.
